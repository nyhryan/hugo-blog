Hi, my name is ATAI. I love everything about computers. I also love Overwatch.

# Things I've learned/done through computer science major

## 2022

### Spring ~ Summer semester üìö

| Course | Language | Project |
| --- | :---: | --- |
|Introduction to Web Programming| HTML, JS, CSS | - |
|A wise daily life of Python with RPA| Python | [Simple movie info web crawling](/posts/portfolio/Simple-movie-data-web-crawling-with-Python) |
|Introduction to coding got problem solving| Python Basics| - |

It was my first time making something out of programming languages I learned. The project was final project of *RPA(Robotic process automation)* Python course. It was pretty fun to utilize knowledges I learned from various courses.

### Summer Break üçπ
- none

### Fall ~ Winter semester üìö

| Course | Language | Project |
| --- | :---: | --- |
| Computer Programming | C | - |
| Programming Lab | C | [Dodge game with C and WIN32 API](/posts/portfolio/dodge-game-with-c-and-win32-api) |

This was final project of Programming Lab course. It was first time making a game program. I leared some of basics of game programming concepts such as delta time, frame buffering.

### Winter Break ‚õÑ
- Tried making [simple bot for Discord](https://github.com/nyhryan/ATAI_BOT2) using discord.js.
    - It was pretty challenging to make something with what I am not familiar with.
- Hansung University Winter Coding Camp: [Notes uploaded to GitHub](https://github.com/nyhryan/coding-camp-2022)
    - It was a great time to study LeetCode types of coding problems. Studied about dynamic programming, quite brain bugging but it is such a fascinating way to analyze problems.

### Summmer Break üçπ
- Studied *basics of game programming* using C++ and SDL2 [(Book by Sanjay Madhav)](https://www.amazon.com/Game-Programming-Creating-Games-Design/dp/0134597206)
    - Basic tetris game with `C++ & SDL2`
    - GitHub: [nyhryan/Tetris-SDL2](https://github.com/nyhryan/Tetris-SDL2)
    - Unedited live stream of coding this : [Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzsmEy2tivB7JIjN0vIaIoXGTX2uT_sqd)
- Personalized *.dotfiles* of `git, neovim, vim, etc` with `stow` for Linux/Unix systems
    - The more I got familiar with git, vim, linux commands, I felt the need for having my own dotfile(configuration files) repository.
    - GitHub: [nyhryan/ATAI-Dotfiles](https://github.com/nyhryan/ATAI-Dotfiles)
- *Pathfinding algorithm visualization* with `HTML & Typescript & CSS`
    - Pathfinding algorithm in the game programming book was very fascinating. I tried to visualize them with simple TypeScript project.
