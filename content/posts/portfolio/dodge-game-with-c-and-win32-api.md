## Info
This is the project for "Programmming Lab" course. It uses `C` and basic console manipulation with `WIN32 API`. It uses C file I/O feature for saving high scores, which I learned from the same class. Also applied double buffering for smoother console output.

Enemies in this game flies around screen in multiple ways using simple math. You can collect ðŸ’° items(rendered as `$`) for scores and ðŸ§¡ for extra life.
